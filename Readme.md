# Getting started

This is the backend REST API for the web app I built [crypto](https://ifeanyi-crypto.netlify.app)

To run the app use `npm start`

To install all the dependencies `npm install`

## env variables

There are end points that require an api key to gain access, to get your own api key, go to the following website

## Node-fetch

You need to install a package called `node-fetch` to be able to make fetch requests in Node.js

You have to install version two (2) to be able to use `require`

```javascript
"node-fetch": "^2.6.7",
```
